## Architecture Overview

  - Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
  - Tailwind CSS: For utility-first CSS styling.

## Design Decision Explanation
  - TypeScript: Chosen for its ability to catch errors at compile-time and provide a better development experience.
  - Next.js: Selected for its performance optimizations and ease of creating both static and server-rendered pages.
  - Tailwind CSS: Used for its flexibility and ease of creating responsive designs without writing custom CSS.
